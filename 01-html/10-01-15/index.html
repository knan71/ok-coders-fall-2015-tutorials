  <h2>Create an express app, add static content, upload it to heroku</h2>
  <hr class="hr">

  <!-- paragraph #1 -->
  <p>Create a new Express web application. Do not reuse previous express applications. The intent is to practice using the command line and creating applications from scratch quickly.</p>
  <!-- paragraph #2 -->
  <p>Copy all the html files from the html directory in this repository into the public directory of your express application. Don't put them in an 'html' folder. Place them directly in the public directory.</p>
  <!-- paragraph #3 -->
  <p>Each html file includes plain text that you should mark up with html. Refer to each html file for further instructions.</p>
  <!-- paragraph #4 -->
  <p>Test your application locally as you go, and upload the express application to heroku using git. You'll need to create a git repository, continually add content to it, create a heroku application, and upload to it.</p>

  <!-- header #2-->
  <h2>Review the html elements</h2>
  <hr class="hr">
  <!-- paragraph #5 -->
  <p>Mozilla has excellent html documention. Review the elements list, paying special attention to the new html5 elements. View the documentation for a few of the elements.</p>
  <!-- paragraph #6 -->
  <p>The intent is to familiarize you with Mozilla's html documentation. You may need to use elements in the future that we do not cover in class.</p>
